# Archived Documentation

Legacy references retained for historical context. These guides are no longer part of the active workflow:

- `PHOTO_SMS_SETUP.md` (Twilio SMS photo delivery – superseded by push notifications)
- `STRIPE_PAYOUT_FIX.md` (Old payout troubleshooting notes – replaced by current driver payout flow)

If you need to restore any file, retrieve it from Git history or move it back into the project root.
