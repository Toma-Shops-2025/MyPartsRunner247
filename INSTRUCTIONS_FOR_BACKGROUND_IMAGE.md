# Instructions for Adding the Delivery Car Background Image

## What I've Done
I've updated the HeroSection component to use the delivery car image as a full-screen background that covers the entire area shown in your screenshot.

## What You Need to Do
1. **Save the delivery car image** to the `public` folder in your project
2. **Name the image file** `delivery-car-background.jpg`
3. **Place it in** `C:\Users\T O M A\Downloads\MyPartsRunner247\public\delivery-car-background.jpg`

## Changes Made
- ✅ Updated the HeroSection component to use a full-screen background image
- ✅ Added a dark overlay (40% opacity) for better text readability
- ✅ Changed all text colors to white/light colors for better contrast
- ✅ Updated button styles to work well over the background
- ✅ Made the section full-screen height (`min-h-screen`)
- ✅ Set background to cover the entire area with proper positioning

## How It Works
The background image will:
- Cover the entire hero section area
- Scale to fit the screen while maintaining aspect ratio
- Have a dark overlay to ensure text remains readable
- Be positioned to show the delivery car prominently

Once you add the image file, the delivery car will appear as the background covering the entire area shown in your screenshot!
