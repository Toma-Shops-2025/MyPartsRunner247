# 🚨 URGENT: Stripe Connect Quick Fix

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Required**

Your drivers aren't getting paid because Stripe Connect isn't properly set up. Here's how to fix it:

---

## 🔧 **Step 1: Complete Stripe Connect Platform Onboarding (5 minutes)**

### **Go to Stripe Dashboard:**
1. **Visit**: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Login** with your Stripe account
3. **Navigate to**: Connect → Settings → Platform profile

### **Fill Out Required Information:**
```
Business Information:
- Company Name: MyPartsRunner
- Business Type: Technology Platform
- Website: https://mypartsrunner.com
- Description: On-demand parts delivery platform connecting customers with drivers

Business Model:
- How you make money: Platform takes 30% commission from each delivery
- Payment flow: Customers pay through platform, drivers receive 70%

User Base:
- Who uses your platform: Customers needing parts delivered, drivers earning money
- Geographic scope: United States (all 50 states)

Compliance:
- Anti-money laundering: Standard KYC procedures
- Data protection: Standard data protection practices
```

### **Submit for Review:**
- Click "Submit for Review"
- Wait 1-2 business days for approval
- You'll get an email when approved

---

## 🔧 **Step 2: Check Current Driver Status (2 minutes)**

### **Run This SQL Query in Supabase:**
```sql
SELECT 
  full_name,
  email,
  stripe_account_id,
  stripe_connected,
  created_at
FROM profiles 
WHERE user_type = 'driver'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Expected Results:**
- **Before Fix**: All `stripe_account_id` will be NULL
- **After Fix**: Drivers will have Stripe Connect account IDs

---

## 🔧 **Step 3: Test Driver Account Creation (5 minutes)**

### **After Stripe Approval:**
1. **Go to Driver Dashboard**
2. **Click "Connect Payment Method"**
3. **Should work without errors now**

### **What Should Happen:**
1. Driver clicks button
2. Stripe Connect account is created
3. Driver completes onboarding
4. `stripe_account_id` is stored in database
5. Future payments go to driver account

---

## 🔧 **Step 4: Verify Payment Flow (5 minutes)**

### **Test a Payment:**
1. **Create a test order**
2. **Assign to a driver with Stripe account**
3. **Process payment**
4. **Check Stripe Dashboard**

### **What Should Happen:**
- **Customer pays**: $100
- **Platform gets**: $30 (30% fee)
- **Driver gets**: $70 (70% payout)
- **Both appear in Stripe Dashboard**

---

## 🚨 **Why This Happened**

### **Root Cause:**
Stripe Connect requires the platform (you) to complete onboarding before drivers can create accounts. Without this:
- Driver account creation fails
- All payments go to your account
- Drivers never get paid

### **The Fix:**
Complete platform onboarding → Drivers can create accounts → Payments go to drivers
