# 📱 Delivery Photo SMS Setup Guide

## Overview
This feature automatically sends delivery photos to customers via SMS/MMS when drivers complete deliveries, just like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and other major delivery services.

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Get Twilio Account
1. Sign up at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)
2. Get a phone number for sending SMS/MMS
3. Get your Account SID and Auth Token

### 2. Add Environment Variables to Netlify
In your Netlify dashboard, add these environment variables:
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### 3. Install Twilio in Netlify Functions
The function will automatically install Twilio when deployed.

```

### Photo Quality

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Twilio not configured**: Check environment variables
2. **Phone number format**: Use +1XXXXXXXXXX format

### Testing:
1. Test with your own phone number first
2. Check Twilio console for delivery status
3. Verify customer receives photo

## 📈 Scaling
- **100 deliveries/day**: ~$22/month
